# Contact Form Project

This project provides a sleek and responsive contact form built with plain HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS framework), and JavaScript. It features real-time email validation feedback and a dynamic success message that appears upon successful form submission.

## Features

*   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.
*   **Real-time Email Validation:** Provides immediate feedback for invalid email inputs (e.g., missing '@' symbol).
*   **Dynamic Success Message:** Upon valid submission, the form gracefully disappears and is replaced by a large, green success message that slides into view with a smooth CSS transition.
*   **Modern UI:** Clean and user-friendly interface powered by Tailwind CSS.
*   **Single File Application:** All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are contained within a single `index.html` file for easy deployment.
*   **Company Logo Integration:** Displays a company logo at the top of the form (requires `company_logo.png` in the project root).

## Setup and Usage

1.  **Clone the repository (or save the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd contact-form-project
    ```
    If you're just getting the files, ensure `index.html` and `company_logo.png` are in the same directory.

2.  **Place your company logo:** Ensure your `company_logo.png` file is in the root directory of the project.

3.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

The form will be displayed, and you can interact with it. Fill in the fields, observe the real-time email validation, and submit to see the success message.
